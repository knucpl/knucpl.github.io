	abstract = {Evaluating satellite ability in capturing sudden natural disasters such as heavy snowstorms is a topic of societal interest. This paper presents a rapid qualitative analysis of an intense snowfall in Madrid using data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, specifically the GPM IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) Late Precipitation L3 Half Hourly 0.1° × 0.1° V06 estimates of precipitation (IMERG-Late), and Sentinel-2 imagery. The main research question addressed is the consistency of ground observations, model outputs and satellite data, a topic of major interest for an appropriate and timely societal response to severe weather episodes. Indeed, the choice of the ‘Late’ product over the IMERG ‘Final’ or other GPM datasets was motivated by the availability of data for near real-time response to the storm. Additionally, the 30-min temporal resolution of the product would in principle allow for a detailed analysis of the dynamic processes involved in the snowstorm. Using several complementary data sources, it is shown that optical remote sensing sensors (Sentinel) add value to existing ground data and that is invaluable for rapid response to severe meteorological events such as Filomena. Regarding the GPM precipitation radar, the sampling of the GPM-core satellite was insufficient to provide the IMERG algorithm with enough quality data to correctly represent the actual sequence of precipitation. Without corrections, the total precipitation differs from observations by a factor of two. The difficulties of retrieving precipitation with radiometers over snow-covered surfaces was a major factor for the mismatch. Thus, the calibrated precipitation product did not fully capture the historic storm, and neither did the IR-based element of the IMERG-Late product, which is a neural network merging of microwave and infrared data. It follows that increased temporal resolution of spaceborne microwave sensors and improved retrieval of precipitation from radiometers are critical in order to provide a complete account of these sorts of extreme, significant, short-duration cases. Otherwise, the high-quality, radar and radiometer data feeding the high temporal resolution algorithms simply slip through the grasp of the ascending and descending orbits, leaving little quality data to be interpolated into successive overpasses.},

	abstract = {The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Double-Moment 7-Class (WDM7) cloud microphysics scheme was developed to parameterize cloud and precipitation processes explicitly for mesoscale phenomena in the Korean Integrated Model system. However, the WDM7 scheme has not been evaluated for any precipitating convection system over the Korean peninsula. This study modified WDM7 and evaluated simulated convection during summer and winter. The suggested modifications included the integration of the new fall velocity–diameter relationship of raindrops and mass-weighted terminal velocity of solid-phase precipitable hydrometeors (the latter is for representing mixed-phase particles). The mass-weighted terminal velocity for snow and graupel has been suggested by Dudhia et al. (2008) to allow for a more realistic representation of partially rimed particles. The WDM7 scheme having an additional hail category does not apply this terminal velocity only for hail. Additionally, the impact of enhanced collision-coalescence (C-C) efficiency was investigated. An experiment with enhanced C-C efficiency overall improved the precipitation skill scores, such as probability of detection, equitable threat score, and spatial pattern correlation, compared with those of the control experiment for the summer and winter cases. With application of the new mass-weighted terminal velocity of solid-phase hydrometeors, the hail mixing ratio at the surface was considerably reduced, and rain shafts slowed down low-level winds for the winter convective system. Consequently, the simulated hydrometeors were consistent with observations retrieved via remote sensing. The fall velocity–diameter relationship of raindrops further reduced the cloud ice amount. The proposed modifications in our study improved the simulated precipitation and hydrometeor profiles, especially for the selected winter convection case.},

	abstract = {This study uses high-resolution radar and surface observations to investigate the finescale structural evo- lution of airflow and precipitation over complex terrain in the Pyeongchang area, South Korea. The Taebaek Mountain range (TMR) runs parallel to the northeastern coast of South Korea, with a perpendicular ridge known as the Pyeongchang branch (PCB). The objective of this study was to identify the mechanisms of wintertime precipitation over these topographic features during the passage of a low pressure system (LPS) through the southern Korean Peninsula. The analysis indicates that intense precipitation occurred over the southwestern and northeastern sides of the TMR during stage I but only over the northeastern side during stage II. The prevailing southwesterly winds were dominated by warm advection associated with the LPS over the PCB during stage I. These prevailing southwesterly winds locally enhanced precipitation on the south- western end of the PCB; multiple influences of mountain waves, airflow convergence, and drifted particles are possible factors for causing precipitation on the northeastern side of the TMR. During stage II, the prevailing winds changed from easterlies to northeasterlies offshore from Gangneung. The easterly winds decelerated and were deflected locally along the mountainous coast, and this blocked zone interacted with the oncoming flow to trigger a precipitation band. Consequently, the northeasterly winds helped push the precipitation band toward the coast, causing heavy precipitation in Gangneung. The observational evidence presented shows that the interaction of temporally changing winds accompanying the movement of an LPS over topography is a critical factor for determining the distribution and intensity of precipitation.

We compared four different schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, namely the double-moment 6-class (WDM6), the WRF single-moment 6-class (WSM6), and Thompson and Morrison parameterizations. Both WSM6 and WDM6 overestimated the precipitation amount for the shallow precipitation system because of the substantial amount of cloud ice, mostly generated by the deposition process. The simulated precipitation amount and distribution for the deep precipitation system showed no noticeable differences in the different cloud microphysics parameterizations. However, the simulated hydrometeor type at the surface using WSM6 and WDM6 showed good agreement with observations for all cases. The accuracy of the mean mass-weighted terminal velocity of cloud ice VI¯ applied in WSM6 and WDM6 is ±20\%. The number concentration of cloud ice and the ice microphysics processes are newly retrieved with 1.2 times increased VI¯. For the shallow snowstorm, the precipitation amount was reduced by approximately 8\% because of the inefficient deposition and its effects on the subsequent ice microphysical processes, such as the accretion of cloud ice by snow and the conversion from cloud ice to snow.},

High spatiotemporal resolution wind information was obtained by Doppler lidars, automatic weather stations, wind profiler, sounding observations, reanalysis datasets under the International Collaborative Experiments for Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic winter games (ICE-POP 2018). This study aimed to understand the possible mechanisms of localized strong winds across a high mountainous area and on the leeside associated with the underlying large-scale pattern of a low-pressure system (LPS). The evolution of surface winds shows quite different patterns, exhibiting intensification of strong winds in the leeside and periodically persistent strong winds in upstream mountainous areas with the approaching LPS. The surface wind speed was intensified from ∼3 to ∼12 m s −1 (gusts were stronger than 20 m s −1 above the ground) at a surface station in the leeside. A budget analysis of the horizontal momentum equation suggested that the pressure gradient force (PGF) contributed from adiabatic warming and the passage of LPS was the main factor in the acceleration of the surface wind in the leeward side of the mountains. The detailed 3D winds revealed that the PGF also modulated the background winds at the mountainous station, which caused persistent strong and periodic winds (range of ∼7 to ∼12 m s −1) related to the channeling effect. The evidence showed that under the same synoptic condition of a LPS, different mechanisms are important for strong winds in determining the strength and persistence of orographic-induced strong winds under clear-air conditions.},

We explored the capability of three supervised machine learning (ML) methods (decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine) to determine ground precipitation types (no precipitation, rain, mixed, and snow) for winter precipitation. We provided information on the particle characteristics within a radar sampling volume and the environmental condition to the ML model with the simultaneous use of polarimetric radar variables and thermodynamic variables. The ML algorithms were optimized using predictor selection and hyperparameter tuning in order to maximize the computational efﬁciency and accuracy. The random forest (RF) had the highest skill scores in all precipitation types and outperformed the operational scheme. The spatial distribution of the precipitation type from the RF model showed a good agreement with the surface observation. As a result, RF is recommended for the real-time precipitation type classiﬁcation due to its easy implementation, computational efﬁciency, and satisfactory accuracy. In addition to the validation, this study conﬁrmed the strong dependence of precipitation type on wet-bulb temperature and a 1000–850 hPa layer thickness. The results also suggested that the base heights of the radar echo are useful in discriminating non-precipitating area.},

Data from compact automatic weather stations, located along the ﬁeld of play, reported every minute and were post-processed using time series, Hovmöller and wavelet transforms to succinctly present the information. The analyses revealed dominant frequencies of about 20 min, presumed to be associated with vortex shedding from the mountain ridges, but were unable to directly capture the gusts that affected the competitors. The systemic challenges from this and previous projects are reviewed. They include the lack of adequate scientiﬁc knowledge of microscale processes, gaps in modeling, the need for post-processing, forecast techniques, managing ever-changing service requirements and highlights the role of observations and the critical role of the forecaster. These challenges also apply to future high-resolution operational weather and warning services.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The WISSDOM (Wind Synthesis System using Doppler Measurements) synthesis
scheme was developed to derive high-resolution 3-dimensional (3D) winds
under clear-air conditions. From this variational-based scheme, detailed
wind information was obtained from scanning Doppler lidars, automatic
weather stations (AWSs), sounding observations, and local reanalysis datasets
(LDAPS, Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System), which were utilized
as constraints to minimize the cost function. The objective of this study is
to evaluate the performance and accuracy of derived 3D winds from this
modified scheme. A strong wind event was selected to demonstrate its
performance over complex terrain in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The size of
the test domain is 12×12 km2 extended up to 3 km a.m.s.l. (above mean
sea level) height with a remarkably high horizontal and vertical resolution of
50 m. The derived winds reveal that reasonable patterns were explored from a control run, as they have significant similarity with the sounding observations.
The results of intercomparisons show that the correlation coefficients
between derived horizontal winds and sounding observations are 0.97 and 0.87 for u- and v-component winds, respectively, and the averaged bias (root mean square deviation, RMSD) of horizontal winds is between −0.78 and 0.09 (1.77 and 1.65) m s−1. The correlation coefficients between
WISSDOM-derived winds and lidar QVP (quasi-vertical profile) are 0.84 and
0.35 for u- and v-component winds, respectively, and the averaged bias
(RMSD) of horizontal winds is between 2.83 and 2.26 (3.69 and 2.92) m s−1. The statistical errors also reveal a satisfying performance of the
retrieved 3D winds; the median values of wind directions are
−5 to 5 (0 to 2.5)∘, the wind speed is approximately −1 to 3 m s−1 (−1 to 0.5 m s−1), and the vertical velocity is −0.2 to 0.6 m s−1 compared with the lidar QVP (sounding observations). A series of sensitivity tests with different weighting coefficients, radius of influence (RI) in interpolation, and various combination of different datasets were also
performed. The results indicate that the present setting of the control run
is the optimal reference to WISSDOM synthesis in this event and will help
verify the impacts against various scenarios and observational references in this area.},

This study investigates the performance of eight operational and four research-based SWER(Ze) relationships utilizing Precipitation Imaging Probe (PIP) observations from the International Collaborative Experiment for Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (ICE-POP 2018) ﬁeld campaign. During ICE-POP 2018, there were 10 snow events that are classiﬁed by synoptic conditions as either cold low or warm low, and a SWER(Ze) relationship is derived for each event. Additionally, a SWER(Ze) relationship is derived for each synoptic classiﬁcation by merging all events within each class. Two new types of SWER(Ze) relationships are derived from PIP measurements of bulk density and habit classiﬁcation. These two physically based SWER(Ze) relationships provided superior estimates of SWER when compared to the operational, event-speciﬁc, and synoptic SWER(Ze) relationships. For estimates of the event snow water equivalent total, the event-speciﬁc, synoptic, and best-performing operational SWER(Ze) relationships outperformed the physically based SWER(Ze) relationship, although the physically based relationships still performed well. This study recommends using the density or habit-based SWER(Ze) relationships for microphysical studies, whereas the other SWER(Ze) relationships are better suited toward hydrologic application.},

Explicitly predicted graupel density, in turn, modifies graupel characteristics such as the fall velocity–diameter and mass–diameter relationships of graupel. The modified WDM6 has been evaluated based on a two-dimensional (2D) idealized squall line simulation and winter snowfall events that occurred during the International Collaborative Experiment for Pyeongchang Olympics and Paralympics (ICE-POP 2018) field campaign over the Korean Peninsula. From the 2D simulation, we confirmed that the modified WDM6 can simulate varying graupel densities, ranging from low values in an anvil cloud region to high values in the convective region at the mature stage of a squall line. Simulations with the modified WDM6 increased graupel amounts at the surface and decreased graupel aloft because of the faster sedimentation of graupel for two winter snowfall cases during the ICE-POP 2018 campaign, as simulated in the 2D idealized model. The altered graupel sedimentation in the modified WDM6 influenced the magnitude of the major microphysical processes of graupel and snow, subsequently reducing the surface snow amount and precipitation over the mountainous region. The reduced surface precipitation over the mountainous region mitigates the surface precipitation bias observed in the original WDM6, resulting in better statistical skill scores for the root mean square errors. Notably, the modified WDM6 reasonably captures the relationship between graupel density and its fall velocity, as retrieved from 2D video disdrometer measurements, thus emphasizing the necessity of including predicted graupel density to realistically represent the microphysical properties of graupel in models.},

Interference lines, which are non-meteorological echoes with unknown origins, can severely obscure meteorological signals. Leveraging an understanding of interference line characteristics, such as temporal continuity, we identified and utilized eight key variables to distinguish interference lines from meteorological signals. These variables include radar moments, Doppler spectrum peaks, and the spatial/temporal continuity of Doppler velocity. The algorithm was developed and validated using data from MRR installations at three sites (Seoul, Suwon, and Incheon) in South Korea, from June to September 2021–2023. While there is a slight tendency to eliminate some weak precipitation, results indicate that the algorithm effectively removes interference lines while preserving the majority of genuine precipitation signals, even in complex scenarios where both interference and precipitation signals are present. The developed software, written in Python 3 and available as open-source, outputs in NetCDF4 format, with customizable parameters for user flexibility. This tool offers a significant contribution to the field, facilitating the accurate interpretation of MRR-2 data contaminated by interference.},

In contrast, machine learning (ML) algorithms offer a promising solution as it effectively models the complex non-linear relationship. We have developed an ML algorithm to retrieve DSD parameters using polarimetric radar variables in a framework of double-moment normalization. The potentially stable and invariant double-moment normalized DSD enables the applicability of the algorithm in any climatic regime or any precipitation system. To improve the robustness of the model to measurement noises, we employed training samples with random noise. All ML algorithms outperformed the conventional method, with the random forest being the best model. This study highlights the effectiveness of the developed algorithm as a tool for understanding the DSD characteristics from polarimetric radar measurements.},

	abstract = {The accurate prediction of lightning is crucial for forecasters to respond effectively to its related hazards. The rapid development and confined spatial extent of convective storms, in which lightning frequently occurs, pose considerable challenges for accurately predicting their locations using numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Lightning occurrence is often prognosed using thermodynamic parameters, convective available potential energy (CAPE), the severe weather threat index (SWEAT), the lifted index (LI), etc. A high-resolution NWP model provides a prediction of these thermodynamic parameters at high spatiotemporal resolution with high accuracy for a few hours. However, a complicated algorithm is required to handle all the useful high-resolution variables from the NWP model. The recently emerging machine learning technique can solve this issue by properly handling these “big data” without any model distributional assumption. In this study, we developed a random forest algorithm for nowcasting and very short-range forecasting (useful for {\textasciitilde}6 h), named LightningRF. LightningRF was trained by using lightning occurrence as a response variable and characteristic parameters from the NWP as predictors. It was also applied to analysis and forecast fields, showing a high probability of lightning within the observed lightning regions. This highlights the potential of helping forecasters improve their lightning forecasting skills using real-time probabilistic forecasts from a trained model.},

	abstract = {Understanding precipitation growth and decay (GD) is necessary to improve the predictability of precipitation. Investigating the precipitation GD has been mostly based on an Eulerian approach, which examines the physical characteristics in a fixed coordinate system. In contrast, a Lagrangian approach provides a way to monitor the temporal evolution following the motion of the precipitation system. In this study, we employ a semi-Lagrangian advection framework to quantitatively retrieve radar-based GD of precipitation in South Korea. Additionally, we explore the dependence of GD on the following factors: flow direction, flow speed, and relative geographical location to the topography and land–ocean boundary. Our findings reveal that the flow direction significantly influences the spatial distribution of GD. The growth generally tends to occur on the windward side of the mountain range and vice versa on the lee side. The flow speed affects the intensity of GD. Furthermore, we examine the diurnal variability of GD. Due to strong orographic forcing on the diurnal variation, the unique geographical features of South Korea created diurnal patterns near Seoul by land–ocean breeze circulation and on the windward side of the mountain ranges (inland) by solar heating. The GD in South Korea exhibits two diurnal peaks of growth: an early morning peak over the ocean and an afternoon peak on the land. A monthly variation is also observed, with the most intense growth taking place in August. The findings of this study will aid in improving nowcasting algorithms that account for growth and decay, while also supporting forecasters in their predictive efforts.},

The new WDM6 scheme was tested for summer rainfall and winter snowfall cases to evaluate the effects of prognostic number concentration of snow and graupel on the simulated precipitation. The number concentration of snow decreases at the upper layers and the one of graupel also decreases at all layers in the new WDM6 scheme compared to the diagnosed ones in the original WDM6 scheme. Rain number concentration is remarkably reduced in the new WDM6 scheme due to the newly added and modiﬁed sink processes. Therefore, the new scheme produces a larger size of raindrops with a reduced number concentration than the original scheme, which hinders raindrop evaporation and produces more surface rain. Even though the enhanced surface rainfall in the new scheme deteriorates the bias score, the new scheme improves the statistical skill of the equitable threat score and probability of detection in most cases. These scores all improved for warm-type summer cases in the new scheme. The new scheme also shows more comparable features to the observation for the probability density functions of simulated liquid equivalent precipitation rates by alleviating the overprediction problem of precipitation frequencies belonging to heavy precipitation categories. Therefore, the new scheme improves the precipitation forecast for warm-type summer cases, which occur most frequently during the summer season over the Korean Peninsula.},

	abstract = {A new method is developed to derive the bulk density and bulk water fraction of a population of particles from collocated measurements from the Micro-Rain Radar (MRR) and Particle Size and Velocity disdrometer (Parsivel). A rigorous particle-scattering simulation, namely the T-matrix method, is applied to Parsivel’s particle size distribution data to calculate the reﬂectivity (ZHH). The possible combinations of the particle’s ice, air, and water are derived to compare them with the MRR-measured ZHH. The combination of the minimum water fraction and maximum ice fraction subsequently determines the bulk density (ρbulk). The proposed method is applied to the data collected from the International Collaborative Experiments for Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic winter games (ICE-POP 2018) projects and its pre-campaign. The estimated ρbulk was examined independently by a comparison of the liquid-equivalent snowfall rate (SR) of collocated Pluvio devices. The bias values are adequately low (SR: −0.25–0.06 mm h−1). The retrieved bulk density also shows good consistency with collocated Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) retrievals. The results indicate the capability of the proposed algorithm to derive reliable ρbulk, leveraging the compact and easily deployable designs of MRR and Parsivel. The derived bulk density of the two warm–low cases (28 February and 7 March 2018) shares a similar transition as the systems were decaying. The higher bulk density and bulk water fraction were found in the coastal sites (BKC and GWU have a median value of ρbulk and are 0.05 to 0.12 g cm−3), typically accompanied by higher liquid-water constituents (mean values of the top 5 \% bulk water fraction are 0.07 to 0.45) than the inland sites (YPO and MHS have a median value of ρbulk and are 0.06 to 0.10, and mean values of the top 5 \% bulk water fraction are 0.001 to 0.008) during such synoptic conditions.},

While a lot of research on snowfall has been conducted, the detailed study of snow crystals' phase and habit through intensive observations and the relevant microphysical analysis is still lacking. Therefore, a snowflake camera, PARSIVEL, and intensive radiosonde soundings were utilized to investigate phase and habit changes in solid precipitation. Two remarkable episodes of phase and habit changes were selected such as 19 March 2022 and 15 February 2023. Both events occurred in the synoptic condition of the High in the north and the Low passing by the south, which was accompanied by rapid temperature cooling below 2.5 km. During the events of a short period between 3 to 6 hours, the temperature at 850 hPa decreased by about 4 to 6oC. This cooling led to a change in the main habit of snow particles from riming to aggregate, identified with both MASC and PARSIVEL. Meanwhile, the LDAPS model analyses do not successively represent the rapid cooling and short-term variations of solid precipitation, probably by virtue of overestimating low-level equivalent potential temperature during these periods. The underlying causes of these the low-level temperature variations within 6 hours, still remain unclear. It might be associated with mesoscale orographic phenomenon due to the mountains and East Sea effects, which certainly needs an intensive and comprehensive observation campaign.},

	abstract = {The turbulent energy dissipation rate (EDR) is a quantitative measure of turbulence intensity, and it is widely used across various fields. Accurate estimation of EDR using Doppler lidar depends on the choice of estimation technique and scanning strategy. Therefore, a comparison of the techniques is still required to achieve an accurate estimation. However, the effect of the choice on estimation accuracy remains uncertain. This study systematically evaluates the accuracy of EDR estimation techniques by utilizing two distinct scanning strategies: a vertically pointing scan (EDRVP) and a Plan Position Indicator scan (EDRVAD). We assess four different EDRVP estimation techniques and assess the accuracy of EDRVAD for each elevation angle by comparing it with the measurements from sonic anemometers on a 300 m tall meteorological tower. EDRVAD shows a positive correlation coefficient exceeding 0.5 with the sonic anemometers. EDRVAD demonstrates dependency on the elevation angle, with lower angles resulting in higher EDR values. Conversely, all of the EDRVP techniques exhibit high agreement, with correlation coefficients above 0.9. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of each technique, highlighting their respective characteristics and practical considerations.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Winter precipitation types (WPTs) are controlled by many factors, including thermodynamic and microphysical processes. Therefore, realistically simulating interactions between precipitation particles and the atmosphere is important when diagnosing the WPT. In the present study, we analyze the performance of a modified version of the one-dimensional spectral bin model (SBM; version 1DSBM-19M) of Carlin and Ryzhkov (2019), which simulates the change in the physical characteristics of precipitation particles of various sizes as they fall from the cloud top to the ground and diagnoses surface WPTs. We compare the performance of the SBM and four other diagnostic methods that use the following variables: (1) atmospheric thickness, (2) wet-bulb temperature, (3) temperature and relative humidity, and (4) wet-bulb temperature and low-level lapse rate. Three reference WPTs (snow (SN), rain (RA), and RASN) are obtained from particle size velocity (PARSIVEL) disdrometer data using a newly proposed decision tree algorithm. The results show that the SBM has the highest overall hit rate for all cases among five diagnostic methods. In contrast, the hit rate of the SBM for each WPT shows lower performance for RA than for the other methods. These results indicate that the SBM simulations tend to underestimate melting compared to observations. We thus explore the effects of the SBM's microphysics scheme on the extent of melting in cases of misdiagnosed RA. An optimized SBM that uses the climatological snow density–diameter relationship for the Pyeongchang region produces an increased amount of melting and achieves improved skill scores compared to the current SBM, which uses a snow density–diameter relationship for the Colorado region.},

	abstract = {Typical snowfall structure over the coastal mountainous region of the Korean Peninsula is investigated. East coast-type snowfall (ET) due to the lake-effect over the East Sea of Korea is dominant for snowfall intensity and duration. The ET can be divided by the high-pressure system over the Gaema Plateau (GH) and the extratropical low-pressure system passing southern part of the Korean Peninsula in addition to the GH pattern (GHSL). Composite analysis showed that the GHSL can allow a greater inflow of the snowfall from the sea into the land than the GH. The key factors for snowfall structure are 1) the wind-turning layer (WTL), which is the transition level from the lower-level easterly to the upper-level westerly; 2) vertical wind shear suppressing updrafts near the WTL and 3) the Froude number (Fr), which determines the snowfall penetration beyond the mountain. A higher WTL height indicates a deeper easterly layer, indicating favorable conditions for inland snowfall penetration. The strong vertical wind shear plays a role of suppressed updrafts near the WTL via downward momentum transport. It is presented that updraft limitation is mostly exerted by the wind shear. Fr indicates whether the weather system is blocked or unblocked by the mountains. It is shown that the larger Fr generally increases with height, which means that snow systems or flows near the mountain tops can easily to overcome the topography. It is shown that both dynamic and thermodynamic factors are important for understanding and predicting the structure and regions of snowfall.},

	abstract = {The precipitating hydrometeor parameters used in cloud microphysics schemes carry inherent uncertainties. The quantification of these uncertainties, together with parameter optimization, can significantly improve precipitation forecasts. This study investigates the effects of 13 parameters in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Double-Moment 6-class (WDM6) microphysics scheme, which define the hydrometeor characteristics such as fall velocity–diameter and mass–diameter relationships, as well as the shape parameter of the drop size distribution for precipitating particles such as rain, snow, and graupel on simulated winter precipitation. A comparison between the model’s pre-defined parameters and observations from the International Collaborative Experiments for the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic winter games (ICE-POP 2018) field campaign reveals that the fall velocity–diameter relationship for rain, the mass–diameter relationships for snow and graupel, and the shape parameters for all precipitating particles in the WDM6 scheme deviate from the median values observed by the two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD). To quantify parameter sensitivities, a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of 256 simulations was conducted within parameter ranges constrained by 2DVD observations for three winter precipitation cases. Bayesian optimization was then applied to identify parameter sets that minimized the root mean square error (RMSE) for each case, achieving reductions of up to 30.2 \%. These results demonstrate that ensemble-based uncertainty quantification and parameter optimization can help identify key parameters and provide a pathway to improving precipitation simulation performance. In addition, measurement sites can be strategically selected based on regions that show high sensitivity to variations in hydrometeor characteristic parameters.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Wind Synthesis System using Doppler Measurements (WISSDOM) is a practical scheme employed to derive high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) winds using any number of radars. This study evaluated the advantages of using multiple radars with different wavelengths in WISSDOM for the analysis of bow-shaped convection in a severe squall line recorded on 2 August 2020. A total of 11 radars were in operation in the areas surrounding Seoul metropolitan, South Korea: four S-band, two C-band, and five X-band radars. The advantages of using these radars were assessed using six different synthesis scenarios: (1) four S-band (scenario S), (2) two C-band (scenario C), (3) five X-band (scenario X), (4) a combination of four S- and two C-band (scenario SC), (5) four S- and five X-band (scenario SX), and (6) four S-, two C-, and five X-band radars (scenario SCX). The results revealed that scenario S offered good coverage in the synthesis domain, but relatively fewer observations were produced near the surface. In contrast, scenarios C and X provided sufficient data at lower levels but less coverage in the areas far from the radars. The scenarios SC and SX captured the return flow at low levels similar to typical squall line structures. Overall, the scenario SCX led to the optimal synthesis when compared with the observations. The mean bias (MB) of the U- and V-winds between the sounding observations and scenario SCX was 0.7 and 0.5 m s−1, respectively, while the root mean square difference (RMSD) of the U- and V-winds were around 1.7 m s−1. In addition, when comparing the retrieved WISSDOM winds with three radar wind profiler observations, the average MB (RMSD) for the U-, V-, and W-winds was 1.4, 2.0, and 1.0 m s−1 (3.1, 3.9, and 1.5 m s−1), respectively. The significant differences between scenarios S and SCX can be attributed to additional low-level observations in SCX, which allowed for the capture of stronger updrafts in the convection areas of the squall line. Overall, these results highlight the advantages of using radars with multiple wavelengths in WISSDOM, especially C- and X-band radars.},

The main objective was to determine the dominate meteorological factors affecting the rain intensity over this terrain. Three rainfall cases were analyzed covering western, and eastern slopes of the Taebaek mountain range (TMR), Mt. Jiri, and Busan City. Correlation coefficients (R) were used to evaluate the strength of the relationship between rain intensity and meteorological factors in these regions, including the wind directions, wind speed, Froude number, saturated Froude number, water vapor, moist flux, stability, vertical velocity, and convergence. The results revealed that the wind direction determined the location of precipitation in the mountains, with the wind speed and moist flux identified as the most influential factors for rain intensity, with high correlation coefficients of 0.55–0.85. The upstream Froude number appeared to modulate the orographic enhancement on rain intensity over Mt. Jiri and the western slopes of the TMR. Low‐level convergence was another critical factor affecting the rain intensity along the northeastern coast of South Korea (i.e., the eastern slopes of the TMR) and Busan (R of ∼0.6–0.7). Statistical analysis of all orographic precipitation cases (52 cases over the 3 years) revealed that the upstream wind speed, and moist flux in the mid‐layers had a higher correlation with rain intensity over the western slopes of the TMR and Mt. Jiri. The relationship between rain intensity and both water vapor and low‐level convergence was also stronger along the northeastern coast of South Korea.},

The objective of this study is to investigate the variability in microphysical characteristics and their relationships with orographically modiﬁed three-dimensional winds. The Micro Rain Radar (MRR) and laser-optical disdrometer Particle Size Velocity (PARSIVEL) were deployed at the two stations (YPO and CPO) to collect microphysics observations. The YPO (CPO) station is located on the southwestern (northeastern) side of the Pyeongchang branch with a relatively gentle (steep) slope. The study period could be divided into two stages (stages I and II) based on the changes in prevailing wind directions and precipitation patterns associated with the LPS. The results indicated that the orographically modiﬁed airﬂow was dominated by southwesterly (northeasterly) winds along the Pyeongchang branch during stage I (II). Compared to the YPO, the CPO always had a much higher precipitation rate and higher concentrations of larger particles in this case. The enhanced precipitation at the CPO was related to the southwestern (northeastern) winds in stage I (II) and was also signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by vertical winds. In stage I, although the numbers of particles have positive relationships with southwesterly winds both at the YPO and CPO, alternating updrafts and downdrafts appear to have accelerated the growth of particles with efﬁcient aggregation processes only at the CPO. In stage II, relatively stronger updrafts were potentially triggered by the impinging northeasterly winds, which helped to generate heavier particles by riming at the CPO. Although there is a short distance between the YPO and CPO stations (;10 km), the changed airﬂow associated with moving LPS is a key factor causing the variability in microphysical characteristics and precipitation in the Pyeongchang region.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Forecasting winter precipitation types and their transitions is challenging because the type can vary (e.g., rain, snow, freezing rain, ice pellets, wet snow, graupel) and multiple phases can be involved. In this study, simulations of snow, including wet snow, using the predicted particle properties (P3) bulk microphysics scheme that can predict the evolution of mixed-phase particles through the representation of the bulk liquid mass fraction, are analyzed and compared with observational data from the International Collaborative Experiments for Pyeongchang 2017–18 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (ICE-POP 2018) field campaign that took place in South Korea. Simulations with and without predicted liquid fraction are compared. Predicting the liquid fraction improves the representation of precipitation phases by shifting liquid (rain) to mixed (wet snow) in all six cases where wet snow was observed. Mean simulated liquid mass fractions are higher than the mean retrieved values, while the snow densities are smaller. However, both simulated quantities improve in simulations using the predicted liquid fraction. The trend obtained in the retrievals consisting of higher densities by a factor of 2–3 between the supersites near the coast and the supersites located at higher elevation is well captured by the simulations using the predicted liquid fraction. Differences in the representation of melting with and without the predicted liquid fraction are responsible for the changes in particle densities and the precipitation phase at the surface. This study demonstrates the capability of the P3 scheme with the prediction of liquid fraction to forecast events with dense, wet snow.
            
              Significance Statement
              Wet snow, consisting of particles comprising a liquid and ice mixture, can accumulate quickly on surfaces and can cause extensive damage (e.g., power line damage, vegetation loss, and transportation disruptions). Some properties that characterize wet snow, such as particle density and the liquid mass fraction, have been derived from observations collected during the ICE-POP 2018 field campaign for the 2017–18 Winter Olympics over the east coast of South Korea. Numerical weather model simulations of these wet snow cases, with and without explicitly predicting mixed-phase particles, are examined and compared to the observations. The results show significant improvements in simulating wet snow properties when mixed-phase particles are considered in the model.},
