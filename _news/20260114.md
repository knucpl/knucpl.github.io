- Our students joined a field campaign (named KPOP-YES)
    - HyunSik (Wido Island, Jan 07–14, 2026)
    - Seri (Gochang-gun, Jan 09–14, 2026)
- They launched [StormTracker](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-5395-2020) every 3 hours
- Tough weather (strong wind + snow), but they gained great experience and came back with valuable data!!
